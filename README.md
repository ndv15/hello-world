# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nate Velasco, and I'm currently learning how to use GitHub and version control. I'm transitioning from a sales background into a more technical role and am especially interested in data, software, and product development. This is part of my journey into the world of tech, and I'm excited to keep building and learning every day.
